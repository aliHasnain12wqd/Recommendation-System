# Content-Based Filtering

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook implementing a content-based filtering system, typically used in recommendation engines. The notebook uses item or user feature data to recommend similar items to users based on their preferences.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to develop a content-based filtering system that recommends items to users based on the features of the items they have interacted with. This type of recommendation system compares features of items and suggests similar items to the user.

## Features

- **Feature Extraction:** Extract features from items or user interactions.
- **Similarity Calculation:** Use cosine similarity or other distance measures to calculate the similarity between items.
- **Recommendation Generation:** Based on user preferences, generate a list of recommended items.
- **Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of the recommendation system using metrics like precision and recall.

## Installation

To run this project, install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook file `Content Based Filtering.ipynb`.
2. Run the notebook step by step to preprocess data, calculate similarities, and generate recommendations.
3. Modify the item features or similarity measure to suit your specific use case.

## File Structure

- `Content Based Filtering.ipynb`: The main notebook containing code for feature extraction, similarity calculation, and recommendation generation.
- `data/`: (Optional) Folder to store your dataset files.
- `models/`: (Optional) Folder to save trained models or preprocessed data.

## Model Details

The content-based filtering system is based on feature vectors for items and uses similarity metrics (like cosine similarity) to find items that are similar to those a user has shown interest in.

## Future Work

- Experiment with different feature representations (e.g., TF-IDF for text features, embeddings for complex data).
- Optimize the similarity calculation method for better accuracy.
- Extend the model to support hybrid approaches, combining collaborative filtering with content-based filtering.
